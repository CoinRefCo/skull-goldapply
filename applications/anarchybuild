üìù Anarchy
üåü Project Overview

Anarchy is a gamified innovation hub, where creators working with AI can build in public whilst growing and engaging with their communities. 

As the AI revolution reshapes the design landscape, creators are seeking a dedicated space to connect, learn, and thrive. 
We have observed a gap in the market - there is no clear all-in-one platform that provides the opportunity for creators to inspire and reward their community via the medium of building in public.
Anarchy offers this space, combining community-driven innovation with blockchain technology to create a platform where AI creators can flourish. 

In a landscape where LLM toolings are enabling rapid innovation, creators are often scattered across multiple platforms, lacking an innovation hub to connect and grow. The rise of AI tools has democratized creativity, allowing more people to experiment and innovate. However, this has also led to a lack of cohesion, with existing platforms either focussing narrowly on specific niches or failing to provide meaningful ways for creators to monetize and engage with their audiences. 

Platforms like Product Hunt or Behance no longer provide reliable homes to discover quality projects or individuals and limit interaction to 2D liking and messaging. The modern day builder lives on X, Kick and Reddit and is looking for active engagement with their community for both educational and commercial incentives. The Anarchy Community Hub will take new-age concepts like ‚Äògifting subs‚Äô (Twitch‚Äôs version of tipping), and integrate this with on-chain staking to provide a transparent platform for asset ownership and fair reward for those who engage.

Why Polkadot? All three founders are native to Polkadot (2 x ex-Parity and 1 x ex-PBA), so naturally we had a deeper understanding of the technology.
The shared economic security and decentralization of Polkadot gives us confidence that we will not have to make sacrifices in these two areas.
Bridges such as Wormhole and Snowbridge allow us to open our application to other EVM compatible Ecosystems to drive users and liquidity. The availability of custodial wallet solutions such as ReOwn wallet (formerly WalletConnect) make UX for non-web3 native users much easier.
Core infrastructure such as Apillon give us an easy to use dashboard for deploying smart contracts and also the future optionality of sponsoring gas (this is crucial for the non-web3 native users we are targeting).

üß© Ecosystem Fit
Anarchy can provide the talent to supercharge art and culture on Polkadot and provide a constant stream of high-profile designers (and their communities) to bring engagement and volume. Current working partners include:
Pollinations AI (2m daily API calls) - https://pollinations.ai/
Morph (20k followers on X) - https://x.com/Morph_VGart
Victoria Fard (Showcased in Times Square, New York) - https://www.instagram.com/victoriafard/
Kevin Abanto (Multi-award winning AI artist) - https://www.instagram.com/kevinabantoarkitekte/
Will Garner (50k on Instagram, Midjourney Prompt Engineer) - https://www.instagram.com/wg.xyz/
The Blockchain Academy (partnership) - theblockchainacademy

Part of the grant delivery will include the integration of Pollinations into our platform. The Pollinations API is currently seeing traffic of over 2m daily events. We are working closely with the Pollinations team who previously have not focussed on storing/hosting AI generated designs due to cost. This integration will allow users access to a free-to-use LLM image generator (over time, to be migrated to hosting applications built with Cursor/Lovable).
Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Anarchy is a creator-first, decentralized social platform built on Polkadot‚Äôs Substrate framework, leveraging its interoperability, scalability, and governance features. It integrates with:
Polkadot Hub (Plaza): For liquidity routing from other ecos, balances and identity management
IPFS: For decentralized storage of design files and metadata. We are also exploring the possibility of the new DataHaven (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250128678970/en/Moonbeam-Unveils-DataHaven-to-Redefine-Decentralized-Storage-for-a-Future-Driven-by-AI-and-Web3-Applications) initiative by Moonbeam.
Apillon: To manage contract deployment and gas tracking
Moonbeam: For Ethereum-compatible smart contracts (NFT sales, royalties, tokenomics).
Who is your target audience?
Creators: Digital artists, designers, and developers who want to monetize work without intermediaries.
Collectors: Users who buy, trade, and invest in NFTs/designs.
DAOs/Communities: Curators and moderators who govern the platform.
DeFi Users: Those leveraging tokenized designs for loans, staking, or liquidity pools.


What need(s) does your project meet?
Anarchy aims to solve the following problems:
Centralized Control: Platforms like Instagram/Behance take high fees and restrict ownership. Anarchy empowers creators with true ownership (via NFTs) and direct monetization (royalties, tips).
Fragmented Ecosystems: Most creator platforms silo content. Anarchy uses Polkadot‚Äôs interoperability to bridge:
Social (collaboration tools).
DeFi (NFT liquidity, token rewards).
Governance (community-led decisions).
Lack of Incentives: Passive engagement is unrewarded. Anarchy introduces:
"Rewarded Engagement": Earn tokens for curating, moderating, or supporting creators.
"Build in Public": Documenting creative processes earns reputation and rewards.


We are product first and we recognize that UX is the most important thing for retention so that is the priority. If web3 offers benefits for the user, we will include them but we won't build them in for the sake of it. We are building a web2 product with web3 features then as we onboard non web3 natives can introduce them to things like staking etc.
Our goal is to provide a platform  that abstracts away concepts like wallets, gas and staking and instead leaves the user with an easy to use application which conforms with traditional behaviours and patterns. Our view is that adopting this approach is the best method to highlight the versatility of the Polkadot technology stack.

1.
On-chain commenting
The deliverable here is to create comments as sub-NFTs of the ERC-721s uploaded by AI builders. This sets up the infrastructure for incentivised engagement and opens the possibility for more dynamic project support through being able to ‚Äòtip‚Äô comments in the form of NFTs if there are helpful towards the subject matter (a continuation of our Hackathon work)
2.
Built in AI text-image generator
Integrating the Pollinations API (adding to the Creative Commons licensing we are currently building in to the tech stack) will allow the user to do the following actions on the Anarchy site:
i) learn about AI (through our education modules hosted in association with The Blockchain Academy)
ii) create in-app designs with Pollinations (later we will look to expand this to low-code builders or have direct APIs where users can directly upload their work to the platform and begin to earn from staking
iii) monetise their uploads via buy/sell features and creator staking
The deliverable here is an integrated front-end that allows for text-image generation and then one-click minting in-app.

üîÆ Future Plans
As we continue to build on the current product offering and the work submitted for the Easy A Polkadot London Hackathon, the plan is to keep adding features that focus on the core principles of Anarchy:
i) Build in Public
ii) Rewarded Engagement 
iii) Community Hub
Enabling features such as Creative Commons licensing, in-app asset creation, tipping on both posts and comments and live streaming builds will provide our target audience with a one-stop shop that allows both profile growth, monetization and genuine engagement with communities.
The first releases of Anarchy will not focus on 100% commercial efficiency. Instead, as we trial and test different UIs and features from closed focus groups, we are able to build traction and community organically whilst iterating on final product offering. This will ensure that when we are at a point for a pay-monthly packages, we have a product suite that matches the needs of our initial community. 

In terms of building sustainable income flows for this product, we will focus on the following:
Subscriptions: Basic users will have the option to use the platform for free, with limited functionality. These limits do not apply to active engagement in the platform, but restrict monetisation opportunities. With the basic package, gg‚Äôs need to be purchased on a PAYG model.
Premium & Premium Plus users will have enhanced monetisation opportunities within the platform, including hosting design competitions, hosting educational content or engaging in incentivised community moderation. With these subscription models, additional gg‚Äôs are automatically credited for utility within the platform.


gg‚Äôs: A credit based system is used within the platform, powered by gg‚Äôs. These credits can be purchased on a PAYG model or included within the tiered subscription packages, and enable users to financially reward designers, curators and moderators.


Transaction fees: Lower subscription packages are subject to transaction fees on every sale within the platform, incentivising active users to purchase subscription packages. 


Affiliate Marketing: We will drive SEO marketing for our free to use AI generator tool. This will provide a funnel for potential paid users but also the opportunity for affiliate marketing and advertising for related SaaS products (eg. Luma).

From a technical perspective, we will look to make continuous optimizations to manage both security and load. This can be imagined in the below order:
0.1MVP - Simple NFT contract, Lovable frontend, Supabase indexing
0.2MVP - Apillon API for NFTs, Lovable frontend, Supabase indexing
0.3MVP - Papillon API for NFTs, Lovable, SQD indexing
1.0OptimalMVP - Papillon API for NFTs, Typescript front-end, SQD indexing
‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information
The team originally began building with a focus on creating an environment for designers in the architecture and engineering field. As we built, we had two key realisations which would impact the way we shaped our product offering:
i) creating a B2B service for traditional industry clients would take significantly more education, perception change and resource to scale effectively
ii) the core fundamentals of design ownership, community engagement, feedback and building in public can be applied to a far bigger target audience - the new wave of AI creators.


As we rebranded from Archisinal to Anarchy (more details on the rebrand/name change here), we started to think about partners which would bring: 
i) a new clientele to the Polkadot Ecosystem 
ii) significant volume and meaningful transactions on-chain


We had initially started to build with ink! which is native to Polkadot (old testnet environment here [https://marketplace-app-client.vercel.app/] - won 3x hackathons in 2024). As we expanded our Product Market Fit, it became apparent that we needed to have EVM compatibility to aid key areas such as social logins and on-ramping. EVM compatible chains such as Plaza, Moonbeam and Asset Hub allow for this.
