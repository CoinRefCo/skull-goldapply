## üåü Project Overview

DotStriker! won second place at the [EasyA Consensus 2025 Hackathon](https://www.easya.io/events/easya-consensus-toronto-hackathon) under the Polkadot build track.

No shooting. No luck. Just speed, skill, and sync. <br/>
The Striker who collects the most, wins. üèÜ

### Brief Description

DotStriker! is a fully on-chain, real-time multiplayer battle game on Polkadot where players pilot NFT spaceships in a serverless arena. All gameplay‚Äîmovement, upgrades, and rewards‚Äîis executed entirely on-chain, with no backend or off-chain APIs. Players fuel ships with DOT, collect coins to upgrade, and compete for crypto rewards and NFTs minted dynamically by the blockchain.

Essentially, DotStriker! demonstrates that Polkadot can be the first blockchain to power a truly real-time, fully on-chain multiplayer game‚Äîwithout compromises, middleware, or off-chain components. It redefines what's possible in Web3 gaming, turning the blockchain into the game engine itself.

You can find the pitch deck from our presentation at Consensus 2025 [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGnnrlCwj8/4VH96olgLoY4KJUq1WA7uA/view?utm_content=DAGnnrlCwj8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h8acaace07d)!

### Why Polkadot?

- _Customizability_: Substrate enables building a blockchain tailored for DotStriker!, embedding all game logic (movement, upgrades, rewards) directly into the runtime for seamless on-chain execution.

- _Trustless Validation_: Every player action and game state update is validated on-chain, removing reliance on any off-chain servers or middleware.

- _Modular Development_: Pallet SDK provides reusable pallets for tokens and NFTs, enabling features like ship fueling with DOT and dynamic NFT minting.

- _Serverless Architecture_: Combining Substrate and Pallet SDK powers a fully decentralized, real-time multiplayer game with no backend, making the blockchain the game engine itself.

- _Performance & Scalability_: Polkadot‚Äôs infrastructure delivers fast, scalable, and composable execution needed for real-time gameplay.

### What Sparked DotStriker!

Games are the fastest way to showcase new tech. A well-designed game teaches users blockchain mechanics and token utility intuitively. DotStriker! offers a transparent, verifiable play-to-earn experience where every action and reward is securely recorded on-chain. Polkadot can lead in the blockchain space by powering the first real-time, fully on-chain multiplayer game with no backend.

## üîç Project Details

### Expectations

DotStriker! is a fully on-chain, real-time multiplayer game on Polkadot where multiple players simultaneously pilot NFT-based spaceships. Players buy ship fuel with DOT, powering movement and gameplay in a native on-chain economy. They collect coins to upgrade and compete for crypto rewards and rare NFTs.

All NFTs, including new ship models, will be simulated on-chain in this milestone, showcasing dynamic asset minting without backend servers. DotStriker! will operate entirely on-chain without relying on backend infrastructure, centralized matchmaking, or off-chain processes, delivering a truly trustless, real-time multiplayer gaming experience.

### Gameplay

DotStriker! isn‚Äôt just intended to be a great technical showcase. The ultimate goal is to design the game to be _fun_. We've carefully considered the setting, the motivations that keep players engaged, and how to design gameplay that‚Äôs rewarding and emotionally resonant.

#### Visual Identity through NFTs

We use stylized, meme-inspired NFT ships to build emotional attachment. These visuals aren‚Äôt just cosmetic‚Äîthey represent identity, rarity, and value. <br/>

<img src="https://github.com/oyonika/dotstriker/blob/master/applications/coin_3.png?raw=true" width="150" height="140" alt="Meme coin"><br/>

#### On-Chain Incentives that Matter

Players are driven by:

- _Long-term goals_: Find and trade rare NFTs.
- _Short-term goals_: Recover more DOT than they staked (e.g., enter with 5 DOT, aim to exit with 10).

#### Gameplay Loop

When a player joins with 5 DOT, that value is scattered as in-game resources across the map‚Äîalongside other players‚Äô DOT. **The objective: collect your own and compete for others, all on-chain in real time.**

This balance of visual appeal, risk, and real value makes DotStriker! a compelling on-chain game, not just a tech demo.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- _Polkadot Fit_: DotStriker! showcases Polkadot‚Äôs unique ability to power fully on-chain, real-time multiplayer games with cross-chain token integration.

- _Target Audience_: Web3 gamers, NFT collectors, and crypto enthusiasts seeking trustless, serverless multiplayer experiences.

- _Value Proposition_: Enables transparent, real-time play-to-earn gameplay with true on-chain asset ownership and cross-chain economic activity.

- _Similar Projects_: At the time of this grant submission, to the best of our knowledge, there are no fully on-chain, real-time multiplayer games on Polkadot; DotStriker! pioneers this space by eliminating all off-chain dependencies.

## üîÆ Future Plans

### Post-Grant Development:

We will build real tradable NFTs, expand maps and multiplayer for chaotic battles, add obstacles like black holes and traps, introduce NFT upgrades and themes, and extend cross-platform play.

### Future Funding:

We plan to apply for more Polkadot grants and explore VC funding to scale development and community growth.

### Vision:

DotStriker! will position Polkadot as the leader in fully on-chain, real-time multiplayer gaming, driving adoption and new Web3 gaming experiences.
