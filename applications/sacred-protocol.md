# üìù Sacred Protocol

## üåü Project Overview

We want to enable social tipping for the Polkadot ecosystem on any social media platform. We want to enable audiences and creators within the community to be able to reward, engage and encourage each other in real time using the Polkadot blockchain to empower settlement and security. 

This goal of this proposal is to break ground, into the ecosystem by allowing for native assets to be tippable, while also working with native creators to start rewarding the community and vice versa to help bring new levels of engagement within the Polkadot Ecosystem as a whole.

**a. Project Name:** Sacred Protocol ‚Äì Polkadot Integration

**b. Tagline:** Unlock borderless tipping for creators through Polkadot-powered micro-transactions

**c. Brief Description:** Sacred Protocol is a decentralized tipping primitive that allows creators to receive support from fans across borders, platforms, and currencies. We aim to break open the creator economy for the 80‚Äì90% of audiences currently unable to tip due to geographic, platform, and payment limitations.

**d. Polkadot Integration:** This project introduces Polkadot-native tipping by integrating Talisman/SubWallet and enabling transactions in DOT and USDC on Westend and MainNet. Sacred becomes a live dApp showcasing Polkadot‚Äôs potential for social finance and creator engagement. This proposal also includes building a Creator Campaign working with creators to increase engagement and community building within the Polkadot ecosystem.

**e. Motivation:** We believe Polkadot is uniquely suited for global-scale social utility applications. Its multi-chain design and tooling like Talisman/Subwallet Wallet provide the backbone for scalable, user-friendly micro-transactions.

### Limitations & Scope Clarification

To manage expectations and clarify project boundaries:

- **Source Code**: The project will **not** provide the source code for the Sacred API backend and the Chrome Extension client.
- **Polkadot Integration**: Polkadot network features will be accessible through our public extension and web app.
- **Open Source Deliverables**: An open source CLI tool will be submitted, accompanied by full documentation, a testing suite, and a tutorial for sending and receiving tips on the Polkadot network. Details below.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

**a. Fit in Polkadot Ecosystem:**
Sacred brings a high-impact, socially visible use-case to Polkadot: decentralized tipping. It makes Polkadot relatable to everyday fans, creators, and developers. By leveraging Talisman/SubWallet and DOT/USDC, Sacred becomes a showcase for economic coordination on Polkadot.

**b. Target Audience:**

- Content creators on ùïè, Twitch, Kick, YouTube
- Crypto-native fans
- Builders of social or consumer-facing dApps on Polkadot

**c. Needs Met:**

- Monetization for under-served audiences (esp. in Africa, Asia, LATAM)
- Wallet-native interactions for microtransactions

**d. Similar Projects:** None currently enable targeted social content tipping on Polkadot with Nova Talisman or SubWallet Wallet.

**e. Differentiation:** Sacred focuses on real-time user-triggered tips across platforms ‚Äî not content licensing, adtech, or staking. It is modular, non-custodial, and built for composability.

**f. Why No Similar Projects Exist:** Most teams focus on DeFi, infra, or tooling. Social primitives like tipping require UX + market insight + payment abstraction ‚Äî which Sacred brings.

### i. Team's experience

Sacred Protocol is the result of an iterative journey through multiple real-world experiments in Web3 coordination, privacy, and social tooling. The team has worked together across multiple years and product cycles, bringing both technical depth and user-centered design to every stage of development.

- The Sacred team has won prizes at major ETHGlobal hackathons including ETHNew York, HackMoney, and ETHWaterloo 2.
- Sacred Protocol evolved from two years of R&D in Web3 coordination tools, beginning with Sacred Finance ‚Äî a ZK-integrated mixer protocol enabling privacy-preserving DeFi transactions
- The team also built early experiments in decentralized social tooling, including a prototype Web3 forum system focused on high-trust collaboration.
- These learnings shaped Sacred Protocol‚Äôs focus on composable, identity-aware economic primitives like tipping, which now power our live MVP.
- Our core contributors have backgrounds in product design, privacy tooling, and distributed systems engineering ‚Äî now converging on making peer-to-peer value flow simple and global.
