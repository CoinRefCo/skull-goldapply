# üìù Sacred Protocol

## üåü Project Overview

We want to enable social tipping for the Polkadot ecosystem on any social media platform. We want to enable audiences and creators within the community to be able to reward, engage and encourage each other in real time using the Polkadot blockchain to empower settlement and security. 

This goal of this proposal is to break ground, into the ecosystem by allowing for native assets to be tippable, while also working with native creators to start rewarding the community and vice versa to help bring new levels of engagement within the Polkadot Ecosystem as a whole.

**a. Project Name:** Sacred Protocol ‚Äì Polkadot Integration

**b. Tagline:** Unlock borderless tipping for creators through Polkadot-powered micro-transactions

**c. Brief Description:** Sacred Protocol is a decentralized tipping primitive that allows creators to receive support from fans across borders, platforms, and currencies. We aim to break open the creator economy for the 80‚Äì90% of audiences currently unable to tip due to geographic, platform, and payment limitations.

**d. Polkadot Integration:** This project introduces Polkadot-native tipping by integrating Polkadot wallets and enabling transactions in DOT on Westend and MainNet. Sacred becomes a live dApp showcasing Polkadot‚Äôs potential for social finance and creator engagement. This proposal also includes building a Creator Campaign working with creators to increase engagement and community building within the Polkadot ecosystem.

**e. Motivation:** We believe Polkadot is uniquely suited for global-scale social utility applications. Its multi-chain design and tooling like Polkadot Wallet provide the backbone for scalable, user-friendly micro-transactions.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

**a. Fit in Polkadot Ecosystem:**
Sacred brings a high-impact, socially visible use-case to Polkadot: decentralized tipping. It makes Polkadot relatable to everyday fans, creators, and developers. By leveraging Polkadot wallet and native Polkadot token currency, Sacred becomes a showcase for economic coordination on Polkadot.

**b. Target Audience:**

- Content creators on Social Platforms such as Twitter/ùïè
- Crypto-native fans
- Builders of social or consumer-facing dApps on Polkadot

**c. Needs Met:**

- Monetization for under-served audiences (esp. in Africa, Asia, LATAM)
- Wallet-native interactions for microtransactions

**d. Similar Projects:** None currently enable targeted social content tipping on Polkadot. Sacred does not require the tipper to have the recipient's wallet address, only their social media handle.

**e. Differentiation:** Sacred focuses on real-time user-triggered tips across platforms ‚Äî not content licensing, adtech, or staking. It is modular, non-custodial, and built for composability.

**f. Why No Similar Projects Exist:** Most teams focus on DeFi, infra, or tooling. Social primitives like tipping require UX + market insight + payment abstraction ‚Äî which Sacred brings.

### i. Team's experience

Sacred Protocol is the result of an iterative journey through multiple real-world experiments in Web3 coordination, privacy, and social tooling. The team has worked together across multiple years and product cycles, bringing both technical depth and user-centered design to every stage of development.

- The Sacred team has won prizes at major ETHGlobal hackathons including ETHNew York, HackMoney, and ETHWaterloo 2.
- Sacred Protocol evolved from two years of R&D in Web3 coordination tools, beginning with Sacred Finance ‚Äî a ZK-integrated mixer protocol enabling privacy-preserving DeFi transactions
- The team also built early experiments in decentralized social tooling, including a prototype Web3 forum system focused on high-trust collaboration.
- These learnings shaped Sacred Protocol‚Äôs focus on composable, identity-aware economic primitives like tipping, which now power our live MVP.
- Our core contributors have backgrounds in product design, privacy tooling, and distributed systems engineering ‚Äî now converging on making peer-to-peer value flow simple and global.

## üîÆ Future Plans & Long Term Value for Polkadot Ecosystem

**Over the next iterations we have in store, Sacred‚Äôs north‚Äëstar is to make DOT (and parachain‚Äënative USDC) the default ‚Äúthank‚Äëyou‚Äù currency of the internet. Every tip will travel via XCM, hopping transparently between the Relay Chain and any integrated parachain, so creators and fans experience a single friction‚Äëfree wallet while Polkadot captures the fee flow. Once this internal flywheel is proven, we will layer in bridge adapters (e.g. Snowbridge, Wormhole) that convert ETH, SOL, or other L1 liquidity into DOT before it enters Sacred, importing external value‚Äîand new users‚Äîinto the Polkadot economy while keeping settlement trust‚Äëminimised.**

- Convert core business logic into ink! smart contracts (e.g. escrow/dispute‚Äëresolution modules) to remove all off‚Äëchain trust assumptions.

- Expand support for native tips on additional Polkadot wallets and parachains, ensuring one‚Äëclick UX across the ecosystem.

- Launch a Creator Analytics Dashboard so creators can track tipping history, top fans, and cross‚Äëparachain revenue.

- Partner with mainstream content platforms (e.g. Kick, BlueSky) to embed Polkadot‚Äëpowered tipping in their creator tooling.

- Pursue additional grants or venture support to scale transaction volume and liquidity incentives.

- Expand integrations with the official [Polkadot App](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1573) (referendum¬†1573) to drive greater on‚Äëchain adoption and visibility.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

Sacred Protocol is not just a proposal ‚Äî it's a living product already in the hands of communities. We‚Äôve deployed on Solana MainNet and are now actively building toward supporting Polkadot. Our browser extension facilitates real tipping using real crypto, directly to creators, contributors, and communities.

- Our litepaper is available at: https://www.sacredprotocol.com/litepaper

- Our MVP is live on Solana MainNet: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sacred/nmhhcmgieandjhccpjokogfnipabadlp

- The current live version of Sacred is v1.2.5: https://x.com/SacredProtocol/status/1931117203312759061

- We've actively tested and fixed issues, such as account rent exploits: https://x.com/SacredProtocol/status/1932556478810055035

- We successfully ran a meme contest using Sacred: https://x.com/SacredProtocol/status/1918314388450402644

- In collaboration with PizzaDAO (https://x.com/Pizza_DAO), we executed our first global donation drive for Global Pizza Day: https://x.com/SacredProtocol/status/1925019532017422793

We're already supporting real transactions with real value‚Äîand with Polkadot‚Äôs support, we can extend this momentum into a multichain tipping standard.
