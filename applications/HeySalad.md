# 📝 HeySalad ® Tasha

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Tagline:** Conversational AI agent that reduces food waste through voice interaction on Polkadot.

HeySalad ® Tasha is an AI-powered voice assistant that helps users reduce food waste by enabling conversational interactions for logging waste reduction activities, receiving personalized meal suggestions, and earning blockchain rewards. By combining 11Labs voice technology with Microsoft Azure AI on the Polkadot blockchain, we create a natural interface for sustainable food practices.

Tasha integrates directly with Polkadot's Asset-Hub to mint Food Waste Tokens (FWT) as rewards for verified waste reduction actions. The project leverages Polkadot's low transaction costs and cross-chain compatibility to create a sustainable incentive system.

Our team is passionate about combining emerging technologies to address global challenges. Food waste contributes to 8% of greenhouse emissions, and we believe that making sustainability engaging through voice interaction and token rewards can drive meaningful behavior change.

### 🔍 Project Details

**Problem Statement:**
Food waste is a global crisis with 1.3 billion tonnes wasted annually, contributing to 8% of global greenhouse emissions. In the UK alone, this represents £14 billion in value and £470 waste per household annually. Current solutions lack:

1. Natural conversational interfaces for easy food waste tracking
2. Location-aware meal recommendations to reduce waste
3. Verifiable incentive systems for sustainable behavior

**Technology Stack:**
- **Voice Technology:** 11Labs for natural speech synthesis and recognition
- **AI Verification:** Microsoft Azure AI for waste reduction verification
- **Blockchain:** Polkadot Asset-Hub for token management and rewards
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js for web dApp interface
- **Backend:** Node.js for API integrations
- **External APIs:** Monzo for purchase verification, Google Maps for location services

**Core Components:**
1. **Voice Interface:** Natural conversation system using 11Labs for speech synthesis and recognition, enabling dialog flows for waste logging and interactive voice responses.

2. **Token System:** Smart contracts for minting Food Waste Tokens (FWT) and managing rewards for verified waste reduction activities on Polkadot's Asset-Hub.

3. **AI Verification System:** Microsoft Azure AI integration for image recognition and verification of food waste reduction claims through advanced computer vision technology.

**Prior Work:**
- Main website: https://heysalad.io/
- AI assistant: https://ai.heysalad.app/
- Nutritionist platform: https://nutritionists.heysalad.app/
- Previous dApp: https://dapp.saladhr.com/waste

**UI Mockups:**

Our conversation interface will enable natural dialogs such as:
> **User**: "Hey Tasha, what are we getting for Lunch?"  
> **Tasha**: "I can see there's a Chinese place in Soho not too far from the office."

**Project Limitations:**
- The initial version will not include integration with all food delivery services
- The AI verification system will have a confidence threshold requiring manual review for edge cases
- The platform will initially focus on individual users before expanding to businesses
- The first release will be web-based, with mobile apps planned for future development

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

**Ecosystem Positioning:**
HeySalad ® Tasha fits into the Polkadot ecosystem as a real-world utility application that demonstrates how blockchain technology can incentivize sustainable behavior. By using Asset-Hub for token management, we showcase how Polkadot can support environmental initiatives.

**Why Polkadot?**
We've chosen Polkadot's Asset-Hub because:
1. **Low transaction costs** make micro-rewards for small waste reduction viable
2. **Cross-chain compatibility** enables future integration with other sustainability projects
3. **Strong community** provides support for open-source development
4. **Growing ecosystem** aligns with our vision for expansion

**Target Audience:**
- Environmentally conscious individuals seeking to reduce food waste
- Users interested in earning rewards for sustainable practices
- Early adopters of voice technology and blockchain applications

**Needs Addressed:**
- Lack of engaging interfaces for sustainability tracking
- Need for verification and incentives in waste reduction
- Gap between everyday food decisions and blockchain rewards

**Similar Projects:**
While there are food waste tracking apps and blockchain sustainability projects in the ecosystem, HeySalad ® Tasha is unique in its integration of voice technology with blockchain verification. The conversational aspect creates a more accessible entry point for non-technical users to engage with the Polkadot ecosystem.
