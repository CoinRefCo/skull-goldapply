# üìù PolkaRTC: A Rust-based WebRTC SFU Engine for Polkadot

## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:**
Real-time communication for Polkadot dApps, powered by a native Rust SFU.

**Description:**
PolkaRTC is a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) implemented in Rust, enabling decentralized and privacy-preserving video/audio calls for Polkadot-based applications. It routes WebRTC streams between participants and stores session metadata on-chain. Key use cases include on-chain arbitration, KYC video verification, DAO meetings, and proctoring solutions.

PolkaRTC is an iteration of **Proctodot**, which won **first place at the EasyA Consensus 2025 Hackathon under the Polkadot Launch track**. While Proctodot was purpose-built for decentralized exam monitoring, PolkaRTC generalizes the infrastructure to support a broader range of use cases across governance, compliance, and secure communication.

Everything implemented in Proctodot will also be included in PolkaRTC ‚Äî including **on-chain event tracking** such as when a participant joins, drops, or reconnects during a session. These events will be pushed to the Substrate chain for transparent auditability.

**Integration with Polkadot:**
- Session hashes and IPFS CIDs are anchored to a Substrate-based chain.
- Future integration with DIDs and identity pallets (e.g., KILT) for wallet-authenticated access.
- Designed for compatibility with Plaza, Polkadot Hub, and any parachain needing real-time communication.

**Interest:**
The team is focused on bringing decentralized communication infrastructure to Polkadot. WebRTC is a crucial layer missing in the stack, and PolkaRTC aims to fill that gap with a secure, verifiable, and developer-friendly Rust-native solution.

### üîç Project Details

**Tech Stack:**
- `webrtc-rs`: Core WebRTC stack in Rust
- `actix-web`: For signaling via WebSocket
- `tokio`: Async runtime for coordination
- `gstreamer-rs`: RTP capture + recording pipeline
- `rust-ipfs`: Upload session recordings to IPFS
- `subxt`: Submit session metadata to a Substrate-based chain

**Core Components:**
- WebSocket-based signaling layer
- SFU logic for 1-to-N peer communication
- Optional server-side recording via RTP dump
- Upload of recorded session to IPFS
- Substrate runtime interaction for anchoring session metadata

**Not Included:**
- No full-featured conferencing platform (focus is on low-level SFU routing)
- No integration with specific parachains (but designed to be pluggable)

**Includes:**
- A minimal React-based frontend to support the primary use case of decentralized proctoring, with features for joining rooms and viewing basic session status.
- On-chain event tracking for session actions like join, drop, reconnect.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

**Fit:**
PolkaRTC serves as decentralized communication middleware for the ecosystem. Any dApp requiring secure, auditable, and token-gated audio/video communication can adopt it.

**Target Audience:**
- DAO governance tools
- Arbitration/mediation protocols
- KYC/onboarding solutions
- Proctoring apps

**Needs Addressed:**
- Enables WebRTC-native use cases in Polkadot.
- Lowers barrier for real-time collaboration in decentralized contexts.
- Makes session metadata verifiable and permanent.

**Similar Projects:**
None within the Polkadot ecosystem. Huddle01 exists in Ethereum world but lacks on-chain anchoring or Substrate-native implementation.

## üìä Development Status

A working proof of concept was developed during the EasyA Consensus 2025 Hackathon using **a peer-to-peer WebRTC connection in a React app**, `actix-web` for signaling, and `ink!` smart contracts. This POC successfully demonstrated decentralized proctoring with real-time video streams and on-chain event logging, including join/drop session events. The architecture and functionality from this POC will be carried forward into PolkaRTC.

Research and experimentation completed using `actix-web` and SFU stream routing concepts. Initial signaling and 1-to-N peer relay logic are being transitioned to a full Rust-based SFU using `webrtc-rs`. Ready to formalize and polish into a public repo with tests and recording support.
