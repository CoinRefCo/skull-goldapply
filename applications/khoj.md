# üìù Khoj

## üåü Project Overview

- **Tagline**: Participate in AI-personalised treasure hunts where each clue is a physical location. Earn on-chain rewards and onboard a million users.
- **Description**: Khoj (meaning "search" or "discovery" in Hindi) is a gamified geo-location based treasure hunt platform that combines real-world exploration with Web3 technology.
  It allows users to participate in location-based AI treasure hunts where they solve riddles, visit physical locations, and earn onchain rewards.
- **Integration with Polkadot**: <placeholder>
- **Motivation**: The desire started off in college when we wanted to onboard the new joinees of our tech club with a different experience that combines Web3 with the real world in a gamified manner.
- Since then, we haven't found a platform that solves this our way and we would love to solve this to onboard not just our club members but the world.

### üîç Project Details

We expect applicants to have a solid idea about the project's expected final state. Therefore, please submit (where relevant):

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- **PoC/MVP**
  - [Demo Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JETJmd9TOk)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/marcdhi/Khoj)
  - Core Gameplay:
      - Progressive Riddles: Each hunt consists of multiple interconnected clues that tell a story.
      - Location-Based Verification: The answer to each clue is a physical location.
      - Personalised Clues: The clues are tailored to the user's taste using AI while still keeping the answer same.
      - Multiple Attempts: Players get 3 attempts per clue to verify their location
      - Real-time Collaboration: Built-in video chat for team coordination.
      - Rewards & Reputation: Fastest players win rewards based on a reputation score generated which can be redeemed later.

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?: The main aim is to increase adotion and onboard more users to Polkadot in a gamified manner. Create an application that feels Web2 but onboards users to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Who is your target audience? The game can be played by anyone as the use cases are broad.
  But the focus can be on brands, blockchain projects, DAOs, educational institutions, tourism boards, event organizers, fitness platforms, and local communities ‚Äî essentially anyone looking to drive real-world engagement through interactive, location-based experiences.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?: No
  - If not, why might such a project not exist yet? There is slight synonimity with Pokemon Go but otherwise the concept of Khoj is novel. It's not present on any blockchain, let alone Polkadot.
