## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:**  
> **Eunoia is a full-stack AI giving platform, rebuilding charity from the ground up using blockchain transparency and intelligent agents.**

**Description:**  
Most startups sell AI tools to existing incumbents, but following YCombinator's ["full-stack AI"](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs) approach, we're creating a new kind of charity platform entirely run by AI agents and decentralized smart contracts.

Our AI agents, **Compass**, autonomously scan, rank, and recommend causes aligned with a donor‚Äôs values ‚Äî all in real time. Every donation is tracked on-chain from wallet to charity to real-world spend, ensuring every penny is accounted for.

**Eunoia in a Nutshell**  
- **Mission** ‚Äì ‚ÄúFix charity with code.‚Äù AI agents (Compass) route each donor to vetted causes and log every cent on-chain (Aptos ‚Üí now Polkadot).  
- **Problem** ‚Äì $7B/yr lost to fraud; 81% of donors distrust charities; legacy platforms take up to 5%.  
- **Solution** ‚Äì Multi-chain donation contracts + real-time tracing + 0.20% optional fee.  
- **Status** ‚Äì Aptos MVP live; ink! v6 draft contract; Polkadot SDK wired into React front-end; demo Loom online; won Polkadot prize at Consensus hackathon.  
- **Team** ‚Äì 4 founders covering AI, full-stack, Rust/Web3, PM, finance; 12+ prior agents/contracts built; open-source repo public.

**Key Features:**  
- Radical Transparency  
- AI-Powered Matching  
- Direct Giving (no middlemen)  
- Ultra-Low Fees  
- Multi-Chain Support (Aptos + Polkadot)  
- Real-Time Impact Tracking  
- Secure and Verifiable

**Why Polkadot:**
Our team is more familiar with Rust, making our project naturally compatible with Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem and developer tooling. This not only streamlines development for us but also opens access to thousands of users within the Polkadot network. By integrating with Polkadot, we enable users to donate any Polkadot-native assets, such as DOT, to charitable causes. Every donation will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring accountability and trust.

**Why Eunoia:**

We built Eunoia because donors deserve more than a 'thank you' ‚Äî they deserve proof. One of our team members (Alex) watched a close family member get scammed while trying to adopt. They lost $10,000, and the agency misused over $400,000 in total. In the end, the family had to go to Rwanda themselves to complete the adoption with just $600 and a lawyer.

That story stuck with us. Eunoia makes sure that money meant to help actually helps. We track donations from wallet to impact, with smart contracts and AI agents doing the work in between. Whether it‚Äôs field missionaries or underfunded nonprofits, we make every cent count ‚Äî and make it verifiable.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit And Long Term Values

Eunoia is a pioneering "DeFi-for-good" giving protocol, uniquely positioned to enhance the Polkadot ecosystem by addressing key challenges, expanding user adoption, and introducing innovative features. Below is an outline of how Eunoia contributes to the ecosystem and long-term value to Polkadot.

## 1. Driving User Adoption Through Simplified Interfaces
Polkadot faces challenges with declining user bases and transaction volumes, largely due to complex interfaces that deter new users. Eunoia tackles this by:
- **Simplifying Access**: Integrating Web2.5 payment solutions, allowing users to donate via familiar Web2 payment methods or Web3 crypto payments. Eunoia handles crypto conversions, ensuring seamless delivery to charities.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Offering a widget-ready interface compatible with Polkadot-Hub, making it easy for users to engage with the platform without navigating complex DeFi protocols.
- **Outcome**: By lowering the entry barrier, Eunoia attracts a broader audience, including civic donors and non-crypto-native users, boosting Polkadot‚Äôs overall user base and transaction activity.

## 2. Pioneering a Polkadot-Native Giving Protocol
As the first Polkadot-native giving platform, Eunoia fills a critical gap in the ecosystem:
- **Unique Positioning**: Unlike Web2 charity platforms reliant on payment processors with high fees and administrative overhead, Eunoia leverages Polkadot‚Äôs ink! smart contracts for transparent, low-fee, and traceable donations.
- **Real-Time Impact Tracking**: Donors gain visibility into their contributions‚Äô impact, fostering trust and encouraging repeat engagement.
- **Outcome**: Eunoia establishes Polkadot as a hub for social-good DeFi, attracting purpose-driven users and organizations to the ecosystem.

## 3. Leveraging AI for Enhanced Functionality
Eunoia‚Äôs integration of Compass, an AI agent for curating and matching verified charities, sets it apart from competitors:
- **No Direct Competitors**: No other platform combines AI-driven charity verification with Polkadot‚Äôs smart contract capabilities, offering a unique value proposition.
- **Enhanced Match**: AI-driven curation ensures donors are matched with verified nonprofits that align with their preferences, improving the donation experience and efficiency.
- **Outcome**: This innovative feature positions Polkadot as a leader in blending AI and blockchain for social impact, drawing attention from developers and organizations exploring similar integrations.

## 4. Supporting Social-Good DAOs and Nonprofits
Eunoia targets social-good DAOs, civic donors, and underfunded nonprofits, addressing their specific needs:
- **Tailored Solutions**: Provides a low-fee, transparent platform for donations, directly benefiting underfunded organizations.
- **Community Building**: By onboarding charities and fostering donor engagement, Eunoia creates a vibrant community within Polkadot, encouraging long-term participation.
- **Outcome**: Strengthens Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem by aligning it with socially impactful initiatives, attracting mission-driven users and organizations.

## Conclusion
Eunoia adds long-term value to Polkadot by:
- Simplifying user onboarding with Web2.5 payments and intuitive interfaces.
- Establishing a first-of-its-kind donation protocol with low fees and transparent tracking.
- Integrating AI to enhance trust and functionality.
- Supporting social-good initiatives that attract diverse users

By increasing user engagement, transaction volume, and ecosystem visibility, Eunoia positions Polkadot as a leading blockchain for social impact and DeFi innovation.

## üìä Development Status

We‚Äôve already built an MVP version of our application during the EasyA Hackathon, which you can view (https://github.com/JY20/eunoia). While full Polkadot integration wasn‚Äôt completed during the hackathon due to recent upgrades to ink! v6, we successfully developed draft smart contracts and integrated the Polkadot SDK with our client web application. The smart contract integration is our next priority, and we plan to complete this during the program by deploying to testnet and then launching the application on mainnet.

### Current Status
- Aptos MVP live  
- ink! v6 smart contract drafted  
- Moonbase Alpha integration underway  
- MIT License live in GitHub repo
