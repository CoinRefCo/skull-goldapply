## üåü Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary)
```
Eunoia is an AI-powered, multi-chain giving platform that combats charity fraud by providing real-time, on-chain donation transparency, low fees, and smart cause-matching agents.
```
- A brief description of your project
```
Eunoia is an AI-powered, multi-chain giving platform fixing the broken charity system. Every year, over $7B is lost to fraud, mismanagement, and opaque middlemen in the giving space. Traditional platforms charge up to 5% in fees, while 81% of donors report a lack of trust in nonprofits. Eunoia changes that by putting radical transparency at the core of giving.

We built Eunoia using smart AI agents called Compass that scan, rank, and recommend causes aligned with a donor‚Äôs values ‚Äî all in real time. Donors simply describe what matters to them, and our agents handle the rest. Every donation is tracked on-chain from wallet to charity to real-world spend, ensuring every penny is accounted for.

Built initially on Aptos for fast, low-cost transactions and now expanding to Polkadot for its interoperability and cross-chain asset transfers, Eunoia ensures maximum transparency and accessibility for charities and donors worldwide. Smart contracts manage donations, fund distributions, and auditing, while our AI infrastructure filters, verifies, and optimizes cause matching based on donor preferences and impact data.

Key features include:

Radical Transparency: All donations and fund flows recorded on-chain

AI-Powered Matching: Agents match donors with causes in real time

Direct Giving: No middlemen ‚Äî funds go straight to verified charities or recipients

Ultra-Low Fees: 0.20% optional ‚ÄúAmplify Impact‚Äù fee to fund platform growth

Multi-Chain Support: Currently on Aptos and Polkadot, with more coming

Real-Time Impact Tracking: Donors track their funds' journey and outcomes instantly

Secure and Verifiable: Auditable smart contracts and verified recipient wallets

Eunoia empowers small orgs, field workers, and missionaries who are often overlooked by large platforms while restoring donor trust with verifiable, on-chain proof of impact.
```
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot
```
Our team is more familiar with Rust, making our project naturally compatible with Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem and developer tooling. This not only streamlines development for us but also opens access to thousands of users within the Polkadot network. By integrating with Polkadot, we enable users to donate any Polkadot-native assets, such as DOT, to charitable causes. Every donation will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring accountability and trust.

## üìä Development Status

If you've already started implementing your project, please provide a link and a description of the code. Otherwise, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying.
```
We‚Äôve already built an MVP version of our application during the EasyA Hackathon, which you can view (https://github.com/JY20/eunoia). While full Polkadot integration wasn‚Äôt completed during the hackathon due to recent upgrades to ink! v6, we successfully developed draft smart contracts and integrated the Polkadot SDK with our client web application. The smart contract integration is our next priority, and we plan to complete this during the program by deploying to testnet and then launching the application on mainnet.
```
