# üìù stampika

(Known as Sutanpu in EasyA Consensus 2025)

## üåü Project Overview

- stampika lets travelers mint NFT stamps from real-world visits through NFC Tags - building digital identity while helping sites engage and track visitors
- The 2 key stakeholders of our project would be the users (travelers) and organizations (tourism board, landmark owners).

- We would like to bring the social experience at the end of travels where people share where they have been with friends and families online. Users would be to view other people‚Äôs stamps and when they have collected them as they are publicly on the blockchain.

- An NFC Sticker Tag would be placed at landmarks and users would be able to scan the NFC Tag and instantly claim a stamp, similar to a proof-of-location. We would then provide organizations with information of when users visit, allowing them to obtain more data points for boosting visits.

- We will be deploying the Stamp Contracts (Modified ERC721) on Polkadot Hub and sponsor users with their gas fees through our backend. This will help with onboarding masses to Polkadot as we would only be using blockchain under the hood, abstracting away the complicated part of blockchain.

- This project aligns with the team‚Äôs core values of encouraging activity and movement. In a world where AI-driven productivity increasingly reduces the human need for traditional work, there‚Äôs been a noticeable long-term shift in investment toward the entertainment and experience economy. At the heart of this trend lies a paradox: as technology accelerates, so does the human longing for nature, authenticity, and offline experiences. That‚Äôs precisely the space we‚Äôre targeting.

We demonstrate a working prototype here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqG57ep1mI>

- Tech Stack

  - Landing Page: NextJS, TailwindCSS
  - Application: React Native, Privy, RNR UI
  - Backend: NestJS, Viem, Supabase
  - Contracts: Hardhat, Solidity

- Architecture
  - We will have the following repositories `contracts`, `backend`, `frontend` and `landing-page`
  - NFC scans from the mobile app will be handled by the frontend, which makes an API call to the backend to mint an NFT on chain.

We will be working on abstracting blockchain as much as possible. We will only be launching on testnet for our pilot testing.

We will not include the data analysis dashboard and related endpoints for the Tourism Boards in this Fast Grant and will leave that as future work.

#### Gas Fee Sponsorship

stampika promises a **one-tap experience**. Asking first-time tourists to purchase DOT or sign raw transactions would kill adoption, so we shoulder gas costs in the pilot.

##### Why we chose the *backend-wallet* method for v1  

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| **Backend wallet pays every mint** | ‚Ä¢ Zero UX friction<br>‚Ä¢ One key to harden<br>‚Ä¢ Cost easy to monitor | ‚Ä¢ Custodial risk if key leaks | **Chosen** for 3-month pilot |
| **Faucet each Privy wallet** | ‚Ä¢ Users self-sign, no hot key | ‚Ä¢ Extra drip service<br>‚Ä¢ Sybil drain risk<br>‚Ä¢ More support overhead | v2 upgrade once Asset Hub integrates paymasters or EIP7702 |

We chose the backend wallet for the 3-month pilot because it saves engineering time and keeps the onboarding path literally one tap. This is more similar to typical Web2 apps which most of the travel useres will be from, allowing for better onboarding.

##### Operational safeguards  

1. **HSM custody** ‚Äì Polkadot key stored in **GCP Cloud KMS HSM**
2. **Queue + batch** ‚Äì `/claim` ‚Üí Pub/Sub ‚Üí Cloud Run worker mints ‚â§25 stamps per tx; absorbs peak spikes and prevents nonce clash.
3. **Real-time alerts** ‚Äì Stackdriver alarms on low balance (<1 DOT) or 5xx spikes.  
4. **Kill switch** ‚Äì `MINT_ENABLED=false` disables the worker loop instantly.  
5. **Audit trail** ‚Äì Each mint maps to Pub/Sub ID + Privy user ID for forensic traceability.

This setup delivers a friction-free UX while capping financial risk to a few dollars per day‚Äîideal for a grant-funded pilot.

#### Anti-Attack Mechanism

stampika runs a custodial minting service since every tap triggers our backend wallet to submit an on-chain transaction and pay the fee. If an attacker can spam that API, replay a claim link, or trick the contract into minting many stamps, the result is (a) gas drained from the sponsorship wallet, (b) bogus NFTs that pollute the dataset, and (c) degraded trust with venues and the Polkadot community. Because pilot events may see sudden surges‚Äîschool field-trips, festival gates ‚Äî our defences must block abuse without slowing legitimate bursts of traffic.

Goal: guarantee on-chain stamps for valid users AND prevent non-registered users not at the location from obtaining a stamp

Threat model we defend against:

- Anonymous API spammers who do not hold a stampika account.
- Replay attackers who forward a tag URL or capture network traffic.
- Scripted ‚Äúgas-grief‚Äù bots that hammer /claim to drain DOT.
- Key-compromise or logic-bypass attempts aimed at minting arbitrary NFTs.

| Layer | Control | Attack stopped |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **1 Request auth** | Privy User JWT in every `/claim`. | Anonymous API spam. |
| **2 Rate-limit** | 5 claims/min per IP + 30 claims/hr per wallet | Flood / DDoS during peak. |
| **3 Duplicate guard (DB)** | `(tagId, wallet)` table ‚Äî reject if already claimed. | Replay / link-forward cheats. |
| **4 On-chain guard** | `claimed[tagId][wallet]` mapping in contract and `onlyOwner` modifier | Backend bypass and double-mint. |
| **5 Alerting** | Alerts if **rejected-rate > 5 %** or **gas/day > 0.3 DOT**. | Early detection. |
| **6 Kill-Switch Flag**| `MINT_ENABLED=false` env flag to halt minting while investgating | Immediate halt. |

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

stampika is an application is built on Polkadot Hub. It is designed for avid explorers and travel enthusiasts who delight in visiting landmarks‚Äîwhether on domestic adventures or overseas getaways. Inspired by traditions such as Japan‚Äôs iconic stamp-collecting culture, where travelers collect physical stamps in notebooks, stampika brings this experience into the digital age.

stampika addresses the need for:

- **Proof of Location & Attendance**: Tourism companies can leverage stampika to authenticate a user‚Äôs visit to specific landmarks. This is particularly valuable for implementing loyalty programs or gamified travel experiences, where visitors earn rewards for exploring multiple locations.
- **Actionable Visitor Insights**: By capturing scan data, stampika channels anonymized travel patterns and behavior to relevant organizations. These insights can inform marketing strategies, optimize tourist flows, and support cultural and urban planning efforts.

There aren‚Äôt any similar projects in the Polkadot Ecosystem. We believe that this is one of the pioneer efforts to apply Web3 to the tourism industry. This could be due to the fact that this project is quite dependent on our business development efforts and the fact that NFC libraries are not as easy to work with in the past.

**Ecosystem Impact**:
These values are estimated based on an number of 250 users and 1,000 stamp NFTs minted in a timespan of 90 days.

Boost to on-chain activity.
stampika‚Äôs pilot plans to creates 250 new wallets; if even 10 % return to claim stamps each day, Asset Hub‚Äôs daily active accounts jump from ~300 to ~325 ‚Äî a 10 % lift <https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=account>. With 1,000 stamp claims over the period (‚âà11/day - 1,000 / 90 days) the network can also see signed extrinsics climb from ~600 <https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=extrinsic> to ~611 per day.

NFT volume catalyst.
Those 1,000 stamps are NFT Mints, and will boost NFT mint numbers on Asset Hub by roughly 50% from ~600 (average mint rate per month ‚âà 333 - 1,000/3 months). Number of Active NFT Users can also jump by 250, a big contrast to the current active number of 60.
![AssetHubNFT Activity](https://i.imgur.com/KE6lHNS.jpeg)

Feed for KodaDot and other dApps.
KodaDot and other Hub-compatible markets can index stampika collections on day one, unlocking a fresh stream of travel-themed NFTs for collectors and giving the marketplace new, non-profile-picture inventory to trade if users so wish to trade them.

Further Knock-on benefits.
More wallets and stamps mean richer data for indexers, extra fee revenue for collators and a live showcase for Venue <-> User Stamps that other Polkadot dApps can query for airdrops, on-chain reputation or cross-parachain quests. By onboarding stampika, Polkadot can position itself as a blockchain with more real-life usage and more than just for financial purposes.

## üîÆ Future Plans

- Development
  - After completing the pilot testing in Mississauga, the team would be relocating back to Singapore where we will work on acquiring more users and landmarks in Singapore.
  - We will integrate a data analytics dashboard for tourism boards that collaborate with us to provide them more information
- Vision for Polkadot:
  - We believe that an onchain future will be the default for most people.
  - We will seemlessly onboard users as we abstract a lot of the blockchain nitty gritty out of the way, making it simple for first time users
  - We can introduce new users to parts of the ecosystem e.g. NFT Marketplace like KodaDot to allow users to potentially trade their stamps
  - stampika would also support an Onchain Identity Layer as we will be able to add more flair and personality to each wallet address. This is optional as well to the users so there will be no privacy concerns.
  - Cross-Project Airdrops & Perks could also be done with stampika as other projects would be able to query the different stamps each wallet address has, thus verifying the proof of location of the users. For example, an NFT project might want to only airdrop to people who have travelled to Japan in 2025 and we could help achieve that goal with Proof of Locations.
  - A very far reach goal will be to allow users to bridge the stamps to other parachains so that it could be used directly in other contracts.
- Additional Funding
  - National University of Singapore (NUS) Venture Initiation Program (SGD$10k)
  - As NUS Students, we plan to submit and pitch our project to gain backing of our University

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

EasyA Consensus Hackathon 2025 Achievements

- Polkadot (Build Track): 1st Place
- Forte: 3rd Place

The project is fresh out of EasyA Consensus Hackathon. We focused intensely on the stampika for the whole 3 days and we are looking to take it to the next level

### Answers to Questions during Review

> How do you plan to cover user gas fees? We don't see this reflected in your budget breakdown or technical deliverable

We plan to deploy on testnet for our pilot testing so we will be slowly collecting DOT tokens from the faucet. In the future when we launch on mainnet, we have spoken to Eric from Distractive and he mentioned that Minting gas-fees can be covered by the Marketing Bounty in the future.

 If needed, we are more than happy to deploy the pilot testing on the mainnet and can re-allocate the budget from elsewhere.

Regarding the technical aspect, the minting will be done via our backend server as of now. We will consider moving to using EIP7702 smart wallets in the future when it is less experimental and available on Polkadot Asset Hub. Upon scanning of the NFC tags, the users' client will call the backend with their privy access token and the backend server will then call the mint function with the backend wallet.

> What mechanisms do you plan to include to prevent attacks (e.g. spam/replay attacks during busy periods)?

We will be implementing the following mechanisms

1. Privy Access Token - With Privy as our account management system, we will ensure that every backend call before the actual minting must be accompanied with a valid privy access token
2. Rate-limiting & IP throttling - We will limit requests from the same access token and same IP to prevent users from claiming too many via the same.
3. Access Control Minting - Since we have the backend wallet performing the mints, we will add access control such that only the registered wallets such as the backend wallets will be able to mint, thus thwarting bot accounts minting. We will perform safe security industry practices with the backend wallet.
4. User Address Registry - Depending on the scale and frequency of attacks, we will consider an on-chain address registry as part of the Stamp Contracts only allows verified users of stampika to be minted a stamp.

With the current mechanisms, a busy period would consist of many stampika users trying to mint at the same time which should be handled properly. Bad actors such as non stampika users would not be able to mint in the first place.
