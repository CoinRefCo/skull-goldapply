# üìù Stampika

(Known as Sutanpu in EasyA Consensus 2025)

## üåü Project Overview

- Stampika lets travellers mint NFT stamps from real-world visits through NFC Tags - building digital identity while helping sites engage and track visitors
- The 2 key stakeholders of our project would be the users (travellers) and organisations (tourism board, landmark owners).

- We would like to bring the social experience at the end of travels where people share where they have been with friends and families online. Users would be to view other people‚Äôs stamps and when they have collected them as they are publicly on the blockchain.

- An NFC Sticker Tag would be placed at landmarks and users would be able to scan the NFC Tag and instantly claim a stamp, similar to a proof-of-location. We would then provide organisations with information of when users visit, allowing them to obtain more data points for boosting visits.

- We will be deploying the Stamp Contracts (Modified ERC721) on Polkadot Hub and sponsor users with their gas fees through our backend. This will help with onboarding masses to Polkadot as we would only be using blockchain under the hood, abstracting away the complicated part of blockchain.

- This project aligns with the team‚Äôs core values of encouraging activity and movement. We strongly believe that there will be a strong shift in the world where people go offline and explore the outside world more.

### üîç Project Details

Mobile App and Dashboard UI: https://www.notion.so/Polkadot-Fast-Grants-Application-App-UI-1f8611f020d780be8a63ea729e55d9c1?pvs=4

We demonstrate a working prototype here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqG57ep1mI

- Tech Stack

  - Landing Page: NextJS, TailwindCSS
  - Application: React Native, Privy, RNR UI
  - Backend: NestJS, Viem, Supabase

- Architecture
  - Using a monorepo structure: we have will have `contracts`, `backend` and `frontend`
  - NFC scans from the mobile app will be handled by the frontend, which makes an API call to the backend to mint an NFT on chain.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

Stampika is an application is built on Polkadot Hub. It is designed for avid explorers and travel enthusiasts who delight in visiting landmarks‚Äîwhether on domestic adventures or overseas getaways. Inspired by traditions such as Japan‚Äôs iconic stamp-collecting culture, where travelers collect physical stamps in notebooks, Stampika brings this experience into the digital age.

Stampika addresses the need for:

- **Proof of Location & Attendance**: Tourism companies can leverage Stampika to authenticate a user‚Äôs visit to specific landmarks. This is particularly valuable for implementing loyalty programs or gamified travel experiences, where visitors earn rewards for exploring multiple locations.
- **Actionable Visitor Insights**: By capturing scan data, Stampika channels anonymized travel patterns and behavior to relevant organizations. These insights can inform marketing strategies, optimize tourist flows, and support cultural and urban planning efforts.

There aren‚Äôt any similar projects in the Polkadot Ecosystem (referencing https://parachains.info/#projects). We believe that this is one of the pioneer efforts to apply Web3 to the tourism industry.

### Team's experience

We are all final year School of Computing students from National University of Singapore. Collectively, we have won prizes at 7 hackathons in the past. 3 of our members are part of NUS Overseas College, a very selective programme from NUS that provide opportunities for studnets to intern in start-up companies in leading entrepreneurial hotspots across the world - in our case, it‚Äôs Toronto.

Our team has also worked for Web3 companies like CoinGecko, Mavennet while also contributing to open source blockchain repositories like Cosmos-sdk.

## üìä Development Status

We developed a prototype Android Mobile App at EasyA Consensus Hackathon. Stampika can now only scan NFC tags, send a request to our backend, which mints an NFT on the Polkadot Hub chain.
