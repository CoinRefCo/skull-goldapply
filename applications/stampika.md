# üìù stampika

(Known as Sutanpu in EasyA Consensus 2025)

## üåü Project Overview

- stampika lets travelers mint NFT stamps from real-world visits through NFC Tags - building digital identity while helping sites engage and track visitors
- The 2 key stakeholders of our project would be the users (travelers) and organizations (tourism board, landmark owners).

- We would like to bring the social experience at the end of travels where people share where they have been with friends and families online. Users would be to view other people‚Äôs stamps and when they have collected them as they are publicly on the blockchain.

- An NFC Sticker Tag would be placed at landmarks and users would be able to scan the NFC Tag and instantly claim a stamp, similar to a proof-of-location. We would then provide organizations with information of when users visit, allowing them to obtain more data points for boosting visits.

- We will be deploying the Stamp Contracts (Modified ERC721) on Polkadot Hub and sponsor users with their gas fees through our backend. This will help with onboarding masses to Polkadot as we would only be using blockchain under the hood, abstracting away the complicated part of blockchain.

- This project aligns with the team‚Äôs core values of encouraging activity and movement. In a world where AI-driven productivity increasingly reduces the human need for traditional work, there‚Äôs been a noticeable long-term shift in investment toward the entertainment and experience economy. At the heart of this trend lies a paradox: as technology accelerates, so does the human longing for nature, authenticity, and offline experiences. That‚Äôs precisely the space we‚Äôre targeting.

We demonstrate a working prototype here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqG57ep1mI

- Tech Stack

  - Landing Page: NextJS, TailwindCSS
  - Application: React Native, Privy, RNR UI
  - Backend: NestJS, Viem, Supabase
  - Contracts: Hardhat, Solidity

- Architecture
  - We will have the following repositories `contracts`, `backend`, `frontend` and `landing-page`
  - NFC scans from the mobile app will be handled by the frontend, which makes an API call to the backend to mint an NFT on chain.
 
We will be working on abstracting blockchain as much as possible. We will only be launching on testnet for our pilot testing. 
 
We will not include the data analysis dashboard and related endpoints for the Tourism Boards in this Fast Grant and will leave that as future work. 

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

stampika is an application is built on Polkadot Hub. It is designed for avid explorers and travel enthusiasts who delight in visiting landmarks‚Äîwhether on domestic adventures or overseas getaways. Inspired by traditions such as Japan‚Äôs iconic stamp-collecting culture, where travelers collect physical stamps in notebooks, stampika brings this experience into the digital age.

stampika addresses the need for:

- **Proof of Location & Attendance**: Tourism companies can leverage stampika to authenticate a user‚Äôs visit to specific landmarks. This is particularly valuable for implementing loyalty programs or gamified travel experiences, where visitors earn rewards for exploring multiple locations.
- **Actionable Visitor Insights**: By capturing scan data, stampika channels anonymized travel patterns and behavior to relevant organizations. These insights can inform marketing strategies, optimize tourist flows, and support cultural and urban planning efforts.

There aren‚Äôt any similar projects in the Polkadot Ecosystem. We believe that this is one of the pioneer efforts to apply Web3 to the tourism industry. This could be due to the fact that this project is quite dependent on our business development efforts and the fact that NFC libraries are not as easy to work with in the past.

### Team's experience

We are all final year School of Computing students from National University of Singapore. Collectively, we have won prizes at 7 hackathons in the past. 3 of our members are part of NUS Overseas College, a very selective programme from NUS that provide opportunities for students to intern in start-up companies in leading entrepreneurial hotspots across the world - in our case, it‚Äôs Toronto.

Our team has also worked for Web3 companies like CoinGecko, Mavennet while also contributing to open source blockchain repositories like Cosmos-sdk.

## üìä Development Status

We developed a prototype Android Mobile App at EasyA Consensus Hackathon. stampika can now only scan NFC tags, send a request to our backend, which mints an NFT on the Polkadot Hub chain.

## üîÆ Future Plans

- Development
  - After completing the pilot testing in Mississauga, the team would be relocating back to Singapore where we will work on acquiring more users and landmarks in Singapore.
  - We will integrate a data analytics dashboard for tourism boards that collaborate with us to provide them more information
- Vision for Polkadot:
  - We believe that an onchain future will be the default for most people.
  - We will seemlessly onboard users as we abstract a lot of the blockchain nitty gritty out of the way, making it simple for first time users
  - We can introduce new users to parts of the ecosystem e.g. NFT Marketplace like KodaDot to allow users to potentially trade their stamps 
  - stampika would also support an Onchain Identity Layer as we will be able to add more flair and personality to each wallet address. This is optional as well to the users so there will be no privacy concerns.
  - Cross-Project Airdrops & Perks could also be done with stampika as other projects would be able to query the different stamps each wallet address has, thus verifying the proof of location of the users. For example, an NFT project might want to only airdrop to people who have travelled to Japan in 2025 and we could help achieve that goal with Proof of Locations.
  - A very far reach goal will be to allow users to bridge the stamps to other parachains so that it could be used directly in other contracts.
- Additional Funding
  - National University of Singapore (NUS) Venture Initiation Program (SGD$10k)
  - As NUS Students, we plan to submit and pitch our project to gain backing of our University

The project is fresh out of EasyA Consensus Hackathon. We focused intensely on the stampika for the whole 3 days and we are looking to take it to the next level

### Answers to Questions during Review

> How do you plan to cover user gas fees? We don't see this reflected in your budget breakdown or technical deliverable

We plan to deploy on testnet for our pilot testing so we will be slowly collecting DOT tokens from the faucet. In the future when we launch on mainnet, we have spoken to Eric from Distractive and he mentioned that Minting gas-fees can be covered by the Marketing Bounty in the future.

 If needed, we are more than happy to deploy the pilot testing on the mainnet and can re-allocate the budget from elsewhere.

Regarding the technical aspect, the minting will be done via our backend server as of now. We will consider moving to using EIP7702 smart wallets in the future when it is less experimental and available on Polkadot Asset Hub. Upon scanning of the NFC tags, the users' client will call the backend with their privy access token and the backend server will then call the mint function with the backend wallet. 

> What mechanisms do you plan to include to prevent attacks (e.g. spam/replay attacks during busy periods)?

We will be implementing the following mechanisms
1. Privy Access Token - With Privy as our account management system, we will ensure that every backend call before the actual minting must be accompanied with a valid privy access token 
2. Rate-limiting & IP throttling - We will limit requests from the same access token and same IP to prevent users from claiming too many via the same. 
3. Access Control Minting - Since we have the backend wallet performing the mints, we will add access control such that only the registered wallets such as the backend wallets will be able to mint, thus thwarting bot accounts minting. We will perform safe security industry practices with the backend wallet.
4. User Address Registry - Depending on the scale and frequency of attacks, we will consider an on-chain address registry as part of the Stamp Contracts only allows verified users of stampika to be minted a stamp.

With the current mechanisms, a busy period would consist of many stampika users trying to mint at the same time which should be handled properly. Bad actors such as non stampika users would not be able to mint in the first place.
