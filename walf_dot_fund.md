# üìù Walf Dot Fund

## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:**  
Crowdfunding made Web3-native, transparent, and trustless using NFTs and escrow logic on Polkadot.

**Description:**  
Walf Dot Fund is a Web3-native crowdfunding platform where creators raise funds by minting a product showcase (image/video) as an open edition NFT. Backers pledge $1 USDC or more by minting the NFT. If the campaign reaches its goal, funds are released from the escrow wallet to the campaign launchers (company). Tiered reward NFTs are airdropped to the backers, allowing them to claim the actual product once production is completed and ready to ship. However, if the goal is not met, all funds are refunded via on-chain escrow‚Äîensuring backers get their money back promptly.

**Polkadot Integration:**  
Walf Dot Fund uses Polkadot Asset Hub to mint ERC-1155 NFTs and implement escrow logic with ink! smart contracts. The system benefits from low fees, security, and composability across the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Why We're Building This:**  
For entrepreneurs frustrated with traditional crowdfunding platforms. We want to provide a transparent and simpler alternative.
